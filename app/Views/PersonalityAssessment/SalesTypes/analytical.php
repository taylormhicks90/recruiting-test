<h3>Primarily Analytical: Repairperson</h3>
<p>Repairpeople thrive when talking to a prospect with similar technical knowledge, but they often run into trouble when interacting with non-technical decision-makers. They tend to get frustrated with prospects who have a more passive understanding of their product or industry.</p>
<p>Repairpeople are ideal for technical and consultative sales. They also prefer taking a soft-sell approach. They tend to be colder and more objective with prospects — believing that products should be sold on their merit as opposed to reps' personalities.</p>
<p>These salespeople tend to methodically focus on each detail required to complete the sale. They aren't comfortable selling without a comprehensive knowledge of their offering or supporting technical materials closeby. Repairpeople want presentations to be perfect — an inclination that can have both positive and negative ramifications.</p>
<p>On one hand, it makes for more thorough, successful technical presentations. On the other, it can reduce the number of resulting presentations and sales they conduct and land.</p>
<p>If you are an analytical repairperson, here are some things you can do to easily adjust your personality style:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be more outgoing.</li>
    <li>Share ideas and information with others.</li>
    <li>Look for the positive in ideas.</li>
    <li>Avoid giving too much detail.</li>
    <li>Display sincere interest in others.</li>
</ul>
