<h3>Primarily Expressive: Farmer</h3>
<p>Farmers thrive on nurturing and maintaining accounts or opportunities. Once they have a lead, these sellers spring into action, make contacts, and burrow their way into the account. They're at their best when times are looking up and the sales ground is fertile.</p>
<p>But when times are tough and there aren't real opportunities to work on, farmers tend to stand around, complain about the sales drought, and wish for better weather.</p>
<p>Unlike the hunter, farmers aren't motivated by sales slumps. They're more inclined to hunker down and tough it out rather than go out and make something happen.</p>
<p>Sometimes, getting farmers out of their barns is a challenge. They’d rather write letters, service marginal accounts, and make plans than start something new.</p>
<p>Farmers often take a very creative approach to speech and writing in their attempts to persuade the customer to buy — giving dynamic presentations and conducting thoughtful outreach.</p>
<p>But that creativity and energy can come with a less-than-ideal territory. Sometimes, farmers can come across as excitable, impatient, or superficial. If they want to get the most out of their sales efforts, farmers need to listen to what their prospects really want before they start selling.</p>
<p>If you are an expressive farmer, here are some things you can do to easily adjust your personality style:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be careful not to talk too much, and listen more.</li>
    <li>Adjust your pace to the other person’s.</li>
    <li>Be less social.</li>
    <li>Look before you leap; check details.</li>
    <li>Stay focused.</li>
</ul>
