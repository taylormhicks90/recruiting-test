<h3>Primarily Amiable: Shopkeeper</h3>
<p>Shopkeepers are generally warm, friendly, and service-oriented. They are often introverts and can be sensitive — sometimes to a fault. They often feel they must be liked and respected by their prospects. Sometimes, this makes them come across as being overbearing.</p>
<p>Shopkeepers are best suited for inside sales. They prefer to respond to others rather than initiate first contact, so practices like cold calling can be particularly difficult for them.</p>
<p>These salespeople don't like to be perceived as pushy or aggressive and would prefer to make friends with customers than jeopardize the relationship by being too assertive. As a result, shopkeepers don’t make sales — they wait for&nbsp; customers to buy.</p>
<p>Shopkeepers are at their best in a team selling or customer service role. They will bend over backward to help others but might give away too much if they’re not careful. They like to be liked and are very careful to not offend others.</p>
<p>That often makes shopkeepers have a more passive approach to selling where they want to establish a relationship before attempting to sell. That reluctance to be assertive means some sales never get started.</p>
<p>If you are an amiable shopkeeper, here are some things you can do to easily adjust your personality style:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Speed up your pace of speaking.</li>
    <li>Let people know what you want.</li>
    <li>Don’t become overly friendly.</li>
    <li>Talk less.</li>
    <li>Get involved and take control.</li>
</ul>
