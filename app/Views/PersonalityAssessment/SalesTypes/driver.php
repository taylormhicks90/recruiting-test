<h3>Primarily Driver: Hunter</h3>
<p>When times are tight and sales opportunities are sparse, the Hunter will forge into new sales territories and find new prospects. They're most effective when given the space to hunt indiscriminately and bring in anything they can find. Unfortunately, that often leads to these salespeople valuing quantity over quality with the opportunities they identify.</p>
<p>Hunters need to work with their sales managers to jointly determine which opportunities should be pursued and which should be given a decent burial. They also tend to resent bureaucracy and paperwork more than most other salespeople, so many fail to keep detailed records of their sales efforts.</p>
<p>In turn, they're diligent when it comes to staying on top of their opportunities, but their managers are often kept in the dark. When it comes to sales techniques, hunters arenâ€™t particularly creative. They prefer planned, proven, and direct approaches to pursuing opportunities.</p>
<p>They're decisive, bold, and blunt in their efforts to close a sale. That said, hunters can be assertive to the point of aggressiveness and can come across as pushy.</p>
<p>If you are a driven hunter, here are some things you can do to easily adjust your personality style:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Slow down with people who speak slowly.</li>
    <li>Make an effort to listen to others' ideas.</li>
    <li>Be careful not to dominate.</li>
    <li>Allow others to have some control.</li>
    <li>Show more patience.</li>
</ul>
